# Contributing to Two Hours One Life Data
We value your input, contributions and time! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We communicate on Discord
Join our [game-modding](https://discord.gg/twohoursonelife) channel. A number of experienced contributors are ready and willing to help another learn.

## We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
A simple workflow so all code changes happen through Pull Requests.

## License
Any contributions you make will be released as Public Domain. When you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [no_copyright.txt](https://github.com/twohoursonelife/OneLifeData7/blob/master/no_copyright.txt) that covers the project.

## Report bugs on [Discord](https://discord.gg/twohoursonelife)
It's preferred that bugs are reported on Discord and are fixed by us, as the effort to test and provide potentially multiple rounds of feedback on a PR for a small change is high.

## How to make data changes
This repository contains the data of the Two Hours One Life game. This includes art, objects, recipes and more.

Related repositories include:
- [OneLife](https://github.com/twohoursonelife/OneLife) (Client, editor and server)
- [minorGems](https://github.com/twohoursonelife/minorGems) (Engine)
- [OneLifeWeb](https://github.com/twohoursonelife/OneLifeWeb) (APIs)

The data contents of this repository is made up of many txt files that have a standard format. Editing this data is done with the *Editor*, an alternate game client that is specifically built to do this job.

The Editor is notoriously unique and takes time to master. If you're short on time, you're in the wrong place.

Thankfully, you can find thorough and authorative information about how to use it on the Wiki. Follow these links to get started.

### Difficulties of collaboration
TODO
- ID offset
- Merging

## Merging
TODO
- SLA, 30 days
- Time and effort

## Do's and Dont's
TODO
**Do:**
- ...

**Dont:**
- Submit a PR for a bug without prior organisation


#TODO
Don't make a new feature off work not yet merged, if you do, you'll need to redo it after the renumber + provide further reasoning.
Alternatively, they're two PRs but depend on each other to merge, so both need to be approved before merge and then renumber at once.
