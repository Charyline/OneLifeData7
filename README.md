## How to contribute
(This is a rough draft)
- Make sure you know about the distinction between content changes and code changes (See this [wiki article](https://twohoursonelife.fandom.com/wiki/Modding_Notes#Content_Changes_vs_Code_Changes)). For the latter, head to the [OneLife repo](https://github.com/twohoursonelife/OneLife).
- You should know how to use the game's Editor.
  - Get the Editor by compiling it yourself, look at [this guide](https://github.com/risvh/miniOneLifeCompile).
  - Learn how to use it in this [Editor Guide](https://twohoursonelife.fandom.com/wiki/Editor_Guide)
  - For any questions related to the Editor, ask on the [#contributing-help](https://discord.com/channels/423293333864054833/919848284955234314) channel in our discord server.
- You should have a basic idea how to work with git and create a pull-request, which is the primary way to contribute to the game's development.
- If you're a new contributor and you are looking to create a pull-request, please pick a task from the [list of starter tasks](https://github.com/orgs/twohoursonelife/projects/12/views/1).
  - Once you've demonstrated a certain level of knowledge in how the game works, and commitment into the game in terms of playtime, you'll be granted access to #contributing-forum in the discord server, where contributors discuss with the team before making changes.
  - Changes other than those in the starter tasks made by a first-time contributor will most likely be rejected.
